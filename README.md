# Ultra Amp Conversion Kit

Fileset and instructions for the Ultra Amp Conversion Kit. Check https://github.com/Kuryaka/Daybreak-Cage-Library and https://github.com/Kuryaka/Pulsar-Cage-Library for the respective cages.

This free version does not have the battery tray, mag release lock, or fancier two-tone motor cover. I consider these parts non-essential and would like to keep access limited for the time being. If you are interested in purchasing the files or would like to tip me for my work, the full fileset is available on Etsy: https://www.etsy.com/listing/999885809/ultra-amp-full-fileset 

Please contact me at kurymakesthings(at)gmail(dot)com or on Discord (Kuryaka #0932) in the BAFT or /r/Nerf servers (or wherever you happen to find me!) if you have questions or  file format requests.
