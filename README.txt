Recommended printing at 0.25mm resolution or finer for all parts. 

I found that PrusaSlicer settings have been tuned for better ID and OD tolerances, which means some parts have a looser-than-standard fit. 

The only part found to be significantly affected is the mag adapter plug, I have included an tighter-fitting version of it.
